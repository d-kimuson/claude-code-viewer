Create a comprehensive task plan for the given development work. Break down complex tasks into manageable, actionable steps.

## Planning Process

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Use Read, Grep, and Glob tools to understand the current codebase
   - Identify existing patterns, conventions, and dependencies
   - Check git status to understand current state

2. **Task Breakdown**
   - Decompose the main objective into specific, actionable tasks
   - Each task should be completable within a reasonable timeframe
   - Include both implementation and verification steps

3. **Create Todo List**
   - Use TodoWrite tool to create a structured task list
   - Set all tasks to "pending" status initially
   - Include both content (imperative form) and activeForm (present continuous)
   - Order tasks by logical dependency and priority

4. **Task Categorization**
   - Implementation tasks (new features, bug fixes)
   - Testing and verification tasks
   - Documentation updates (if required)
   - Build and deployment tasks

## Task Planning Guidelines

- Make tasks specific and measurable
- Include prerequisite checks where needed
- Add validation steps after implementation
- Consider potential blockers and alternatives
- Ensure each task has clear completion criteria

## Example Task Structure

For each task in the todo list:
- **content**: "Implement user authentication middleware"
- **activeForm**: "Implementing user authentication middleware"
- **status**: "pending"

Always start with research and analysis tasks before moving to implementation.
